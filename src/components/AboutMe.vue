                    <p class="lead">
                      Ever since I was a little kid, the informatic world has been my passion. I still remember that
                      christmas when I first got a computer and started
                      playing videogames like crazy, that was the moment I fell in love with Software.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                      Many years later I discovered something amazing, something that would mark my life and set a
                      trajectory in my actions and lifestyle. The first time
                      I programmed a "Hello World" in C++ made me go crazy. How was it possible that just by writting
                      few code lines I could get the computer to do
                      whatever I wanted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                      This passion carried me through my education in Centre d'Estudis Polit√®cnics, where I found more
                      resources available to me than I could
                      have ever imagined as a kid. I studied PHP, Html, C#, JavaScript among many other things but this
                      was the moment I realized how much there was yet to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                      So, now that I am able to start my career in this world, this passion remains with me. I know
                      there are a lot of new things I still don't know about
                      their existence. But especially for this reason I am grateful and excited!
